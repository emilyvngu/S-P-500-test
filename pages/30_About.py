This interactive portfolio optimization tool was developed to demonstrate how data science, finance, and optimization modeling can come together to support smarter investment decisions.

It features two core components:

# Features
st.markdown("""
### üìà Portfolio Visualization
A side-by-side comparison of SPY and an equal-weighted **Magnificent 7** portfolio, showing the growth of a $100 investment over time using real historical data.

### üßÆ Backtesting (Julia)
A rolling-window **constrained minimum-variance optimizer** implemented in Julia using `JuMP` and `COSMO`. It solves for optimal portfolio weights under return and allocation constraints and simulates how the portfolio would have performed.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data engineering with Python (pandas, yfinance)
- Portfolio theory and risk-return metrics
- Convex optimization modeling with Julia
- Rolling window backtesting and simulation
- Streamlit dashboard development
